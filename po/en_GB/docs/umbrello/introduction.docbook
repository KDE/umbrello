>&umbrello; is a &UML; diagram tool that can support you in the software development process. Especially during the analysis and design phases of this process, &umbrello; will help you to get a high quality product. &UML; can also be used to document your software designs to help you and your fellow developers. </para>

>Having a good model of your software is the best way to communicate with other developers working on the project and with your customers. A good model is extremely important for medium and big-size projects, but it is also very useful for small ones. Even if you are working on a small one man project you will benefit from a good model because it will give you an overview that will help you code things right the first time. </para>
<para
>&UML; is the diagramming language used to describing such models. You can represent your ideas in &UML; using different types of diagrams. &umbrello; 1.2 supports the following types: </para>

/**
 * Association tool to create associations between widgets.
 * With association tool, two widgets are selected clicking with left button on
 * them and an association of the needed type (depending on the association
 * button selected) is created between the widgets. When the first widget is
 * selected, a temporary visual association that follows the cursor movement is
 * created until the second widget is selected or the association cancelled.
 *
 * Also, association tool can create association class: a classifier widget
 * which is linked to an association. To do this, the classifier must be
 * selected first and then the association must be selected. The association
 * can't be selected first.
 *
 * An association can be cancelled using right button, which also returns to
 * default tool, or with middle button, which only cancels the association
 * without changing the tool being used.
 *
 * @todo refactor with common code in ToolBarStateMessages?

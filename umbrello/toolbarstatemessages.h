/**
 * Messages tool to create messages between objects in sequence diagrams.
 * With messages tool, two objects are selected clicking with left button on
 * them and a message of the needed type (depending on the message button
 * selected) is created between the objects. When the first object is selected,
 * a temporary visual message that follows the cursor movement is created until
 * the second object is selected or the message cancelled.
 *
 * A message can be cancelled using right button, which also returns to default
 * tool, or with middle button, which only cancels the message without changing
 * the tool being used.
 *
 * The messages to create can be normal messages or creation messages. Normal
 * messages are created clicking on the line of the two objects. Creation
 * messages are created clicking in the line of the first object, and on the
 * second object itself (not in its line).
 *
 * Associations aren't taken into account, and are treated as empty spaces.
 * Moreover, widgets other than objects aren't neither taken into account.
 *
 * @todo refactor with common code in ToolBarStateAssociation?
 * @todo sequence message lines should be handled by object widgets. Right now,
 * they aren't taken into account in testOnWidget and an explicit check is
 * needed. However, if onWidget in object widgets is changed to also check for
 * the line, a way to give them priority over other widgets in testOnWidget
 * will be needed. For example, when creating a message clicking on an already
 * created message, the message line must be got instead of the message, even if
 * the message is smaller than the line.

In short, here is how to build current git master on Linux :
  git clone git://anongit.kde.org/umbrello  
  cd umbrello
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/umbrello -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug  ../

When building/running on KF5, make sure that the "kio" package is installed.

Building on Qt4 can be done using the qt4.8.6-kdelibs4.14.9 branch from git.
However, at least Qt 4.8 is required, and at least Cmake 3.16 is required.
